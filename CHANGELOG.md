# Changelog

All notable changes to AITracker will be documented in this file. The project
uses semantic versioning for published releases.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-09-08

- Added pi and oh-my-pi (omp) session and usage readers over their `~/.pi`
  and `~/.omp` session logs (project-grouped jsonl envelopes): pi/omp
  sessions now appear in session management, usage analytics and the agent
  overview instead of "暂无日志" ([#33](https://github.com/estelwalks/aitracker/issues/33)).
- Incremental DSH session scanning with persisted per-file caches and DSH
  transcript resume.
- New agents converge across Sources, Agent overview and the skill catalog
  within minutes: parsed usage/session evidence queues an installation probe,
  and a freshly installed skill-capable agent queues a skills rescan instead
  of waiting out the scheduled cadences.
- Shortened the skill snapshot refresh cadence to 30 minutes and the
  installation probe to 60 minutes (both user-configurable down to 15).
- Added per-tool data-directory overrides on the Sources page: each
  configurable agent can be pointed at its real data directory through the
  native folder picker (macOS/Windows), persisted in the new
  `tool_data_roots` table (migration 0003) and applied to usage scanning,
  installation detection and skill discovery/sync/install (Hermes included)
  ([#31](https://github.com/estelwalks/aitracker/issues/31)).
- Added Hermes Agent usage collection: the registry now reads its SQLite
  `sessions` table (`state.db` plus `profiles/<name>/state.db`, including the
  Windows `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes` layout).
- The desktop security scanner mirrors the registry skill-agent roots (with a
  parity guard) and honours per-tool overrides through the env/test seam and,
  in packaged clients, through the desktop-state broker bridge into the
  `tool_data_roots` table (GUI-configured directories).
- Prepared the repository for public, reproducible development; integrated
  the published `@estelwalks/agent-threat-scanner` npm package; moved
  renderer persistence to SQLite-backed application preferences; removed
  unreachable server implementation chunks from the public browser bundle and
  made both privacy audits blocking release gates; added privacy, release and
  dependency-notice documentation.

## [1.0.0-beta.1] - 2026-08-31

- First public prerelease of the open-source desktop application.
